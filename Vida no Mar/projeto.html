            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                After the analysis it was spotted the need to create this project, because the situation of our waters is worrying, where it is possible to see in a report done by the UN, that plastics represent 85% of the waste that reaches the oceans and warn that by 2040, the number of plastics in the sea will almost triple, with an annual amount between 23 and 37 million tons. So after doing this analysis, and seeing the need for marine life, it was decided to create an informative website. 
Our site was developed after the learning we had in the Informatics classes with Professor Alexandre; it is a site where we present more summarized information of all the research we did during the school months that passed in 2022. The target audience we have is very broad: from large companies that pollute the seas to the population that throws garbage on the beach, among others. The duty of this site is to raise awareness of these companies and people and also to present a proposal for depollution.

            <h3>Marine Life is diminishing...</h3>
            <p>
                "By the year 2300, life in the oceans will face a mass death, similar to the great extinctions that occurred millions of years ago, if humanity fails to reduce greenhouse gas emissions" - states a study published on 4/28 in the journal Science.

With this study I can start this very important topic for the whole development of our professional project. Many people end up looking at newspaper headlines, where they cite climate change as the main problem for the decrease in marine life, and think that they themselves have nothing to do with this problem, but they are totally wrong. 
Greenhouse Gases are gases that emit and absorb radiant energy within the thermal infrared range, which causes the greenhouse effect. 
What can cause the increase in greenhouse gases? "Simply" all human activities linked to industry, agricultural activities, deforestation, and also the increased use of transportation. 
We can see the direct relationship between the whole problem of climate change, diminishing marine life, and human action!

        <p>
            When we think about such a big problem, we imagine that the population is not to blame, but in reality we are. Something that can also enter into this whole discussion is unbridled consumerism. 
As we are focusing only on the decrease of sea life, this climate change is the main cause, but we also observe other reasons and all the pollution that increases more and more.

            <h3>Types of Contamination at Sea</h3>
            <p>
                We know that there is a lot of pollution/contamination in the seas, but we will address five of them. 
                First is biological contamination, which is caused by microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, etc.
                There is sedimentary contamination, which is where it starts to get more "serious", which in this case is a type of contamination that presents particles in suspension that accumulate in the water (organic/inorganic products).
                Then there is thermal contamination, which is when high concentrations of heated water are thrown into seas, rivers, and lakes.
                We have radioactive contamination, which is radioactive waste thrown after nuclear experiments.
                And lastly, chemical contamination, basically chemicals that are thrown into the seas (paints, plastic, medicines, etc.).

            <h3>Technology and the Sea</h3>
            <p>
                Razer has partnered with a marine waste cleanup company (ClearBolt). Razer's intention in doing this project is because of the 11 million tons of plastic that are dumped into the seas. And the idea of ClearBolt is to develop robots that use artificial intelligence to identify different types of plastic waste at sea. And razer has made its support available, through engineers and designers to help design and improve the ClearBolt equipment.

            <h3>Method for Reducing Marine Pollution</h3>
            <p>
                One of the methods to reduce sea pollution would be to implant prize machines at the beaches, similar to the ones they have at the mall. It would work in a similar way, but with a fixed entrance fee, and each PET bottle discarded would earn another chance to play. This way we would be able to stimulate children, teenagers, etc. from an early age to collect these recyclables that would be thrown into the sea. When the machine is full, the pet bottles would be discarded in a correct place.
